                    <p> Dream Tree International School operates year round (12 months) with a new school year starting July 1 and ends on June 30. The school admits students on a space available basis and once the classes are full, the student is placed on the waitlist after paying the reservation fee. Waitlisted children will be admitted on a first come first serve basis. Children between the ages of 2 through 6 may enroll in their age specific classes, but we do require children to visit prior to enrollment.<br> <br> Before children are admitted, parents are required to fill out an enrollment application. Additionally, all students must be up to date on all of their immunizations and a copy of their immunization record must be provided.<br><br>
                      All tuition and dues must be paid prior to enrollment in order to secure a slot for your child in our preschool. Further details on tuition and fees can be found in the Tuition and Billing section of this handbook.<br><br>
                      Dream Tree International School, as its own discretion, may accept non-DTIS students on a Temporary Status (for a set period less than four months) upon meeting school admission requirements. These students will be integrated into regular programs having minimum impact on our students academically.

              <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Dream Tree International School we strive to maintain a positive and orderly environment in order to create an atmosphere for high quality learning. We tailor expectations fit the developmental levels of the children to minimize frustration and inappropriate behavior.
Our teachers do intervene when a child's behavior becomes disruptive or dangerous to the rest of the students. Teachers will encourage children to develop their own self-control, management of feelings, problem solving, and empathy through praise and positive reinforcement. Good behavior at Dream Tree International School will center on principles of respect, politeness, responsibility and honesty. We do not use any physical punishment, humiliation, or verbal abuse when disciplining children. Also, a child is never punished for wetting, soiling, or failing to use the toilet. Parents will be notified of any ongoing behavioral problems and parent conferences may be scheduled to discuss a plan of action. If the negative behavior continues with no resolution and or the child poses a risk to the safety of other children, suspension or full withdrawal may be considered.
Dream Tree International School is fully committed to the safety of the students, staff and visitors. Among safety measures we have, the school will schedule and practice fire drills, CCTV monitoring that are for school use only.</p>
